                <p>The normal pack has 52 cards in it. 
                     These are split into four types, known as suits, called hearts, clubs, diamonds and spades. 
                     There are numbers on the cards, and there is one card of each number in each suit.</p>

                
                <p>The normal pack without any twos through sixes (32 cards), probably first used in the game of the same name. 
                    Also used in many German origin card games such as Skat and sometimes, though no longer often, in Euchre.</p>

                <p>The normal pack without any eights, nines, or tens (40 cards), used in a variety of games most commonly 
                     of Spanish and sometimes Italian origin, such as Ombre, Tressette, or Conquian. </p>

                <p>With the exception of the 63-card pack once manufactured for the six-hand version of 500, expanded packs almost always 
                    involve the addition of one or more additional suits. The most common expanded packs are based on the Tarot configuration.</p>

                    <h2>HISTORY</h2>
                    <div class="line3"></div>
                    <p>Playing cards were introduced during Imperial China in the Tang Dynasty. As early as 900 A.D. cards were hand-painted 
                        leafs, which is why it was also known as “leaf game.” Mahjong titles eventually evolved from the hand-painted leaves.<br/></br>
                        In Europe, the first widespread manufacturing of playing cards were created using woodcuts on paper. When then Germans 
                        mastered printmaking in the 1400s, the first printed decks were thrust into production. <br/></br>Modern decks have special symbols 
                        for the royal cards. Only three cards feature a profile perspective including the Jack of Hearts, the Jack of Spades, and the King 
                        of Diamonds. Those Jacks are commonly known as “One-eyed Jacks” because of their side-profile. The King of Diamonds also has a 
                        side-profile and it is the only king holding an axe, while the other three Kings hold a sword. The King of Hearts is 
                        also known as the “Suicide King” because it is usually depicted as thrusting his sword into his own head. 
                        The King of Hearts is always depicted without a moustache.<br/></br> Jacks were originally known as “Knaves.” Because King and Knave 
                        both started with the let “K”, the slang term “Jack” was commonly used and eventually Knave was phased out.</p>
